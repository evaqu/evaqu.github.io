					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Goodreads </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframetwo.jpg" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> Redesigned Goodreads </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframeone.jpg" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> Goodreads allows individuals to search its database of books, annotations, quotes and reviews. The design allows this by having a search bar for books, by putting popular books big in the front page so that people could easily access to its review page and by adding forums on the side for everyone to share their book recommendations.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The main problem on Goodreads is the search bar, it doesn't appear at the top of the website, you have to scroll down to find it. Goodreads only push four books in their recommmendation section which is too low to see a book that is interesting and that matches someone's exact preferred genre. To modify that, I put the search bar at the top of the website, it's the first thing you can see now and I also put a box on the right where you can scroll through more book recommendations.</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
