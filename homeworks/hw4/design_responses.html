							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> When designing a website, it's important to be mindful of the color accessibility so that everyone including people with visual disabilities could be able to access the website. It implies putting minimum AA rating color contrasts, incorporate some iconography, put colorblind mode on graphs and charts and get everyone to use the same color system. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like the details they put on regulatory requirements that currently exist. I didn't know that so many rules existed to make product design more accessible to people with disabilities. Now that I know, it does make sense that every designers should be careful with that so that every user can access to the same digital content.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
