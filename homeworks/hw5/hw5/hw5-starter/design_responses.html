                            <p> I learnt how making your design colorful but minimalist can impact the customer experience and how well their understand what your product or service is about. Adding interactive and uniaue features add more to the personality of your brand and website. The way your choose color, theme, fonts etc is super important to recognize what's your website about.</p>

                            <p> I love the fact that it displayed different types of websites and how much it can vary from one to the other. I like seeing different style of website construction. I also loved how each product or service have different way to communicate about it. Desginers have to find the perfect design to convey their message. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspirations were the cart interaction added by Danniell for Norde. I find it very intuitive, interactive, almost playful just like a game. It makes the customer experience easier and easy to navigate. It's also really minimalist which helps in reading the main informations that it's conveying. The size selection and the color selection are directly displayed, so the customer can see directly how the shoe would look like. </p>
