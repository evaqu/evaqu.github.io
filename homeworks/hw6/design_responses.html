					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learnt that animation is complex requiring a lot of attention to detail, fidelity to real-world movements and understanding of how users think. This article emphasized well the important of having the right duration, the importance of easing curves and make the animation simple but pretty in order to grab users attention. Animation requires a lot of testing in order to make it right. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when the author mentioned easing curves to make the animation more natural and more engaging. It makes the animations less mechanical and more like real-life movements so designers have to be attentive to that. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world -friction,accelerations etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world allows users to understand what to expect from the interface" </p>
						</li>
